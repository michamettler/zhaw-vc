This is a simple interactive visualization that shows the mean movie ratings by year. Click on a bar to see the ratings of individual movies for that year. Click on a movie to see the diary entries for that movie. The data is loaded from my movie diary (Letterboxd), which contains ratings for movies I have watched over the years. The visualization is implemented using D3.js
